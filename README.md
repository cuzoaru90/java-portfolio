# Absolute Java

Revisiting the language.

# My plans

This Java portfolio is essentially "done". These exercises and programs provide the complete foundation for object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm design. The purpose of this repository is to show my coding style and problem solving skills.

Future updates will revolve around commenting and refactoring previously written code. My Java coding is moving onto the HackerRank site, where I have already begun some work. My plan is to get my new site and some simple Android apps published while doing the practice.
