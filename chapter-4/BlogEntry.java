/* Define a class called BlogEntry that could be used to store an entry for a Web log. The class should have instance
variable to store the poster's username, text of the entry, and the date of the entry using the Date class from Chapter
4. Add a constructor that allows the user of the class to set all instance variables. Also add a method, DisplayEntry,
that outputs all of the instance variables, and another method called getSummary that returns the first 10 words from
the text (or the entire text if it is less than 10 words). Test your class from your main method.
