/* A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death
in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know
how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer.

The program has no input but does have defined constants for the following items: the amount of artificial sweetener
needed to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of the dieter, and the desired weight of the dieter.
To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather
than the dieter's current weight, to calculate how much soda pop the dieter can safely drink. You many use any
reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of one percent artificial
sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction. You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001.
